#### Syllabus Skimming
```
Act as <SUBJECT> expert, and guide me through my syllabus by giving an idea for each and every topic from the syllabus i will provide you after this prompt. Remember, not to tell about every topic at once, start with first topic, and keep going only when i say next. I want that i get an idea of topics before getting into depth studying so that i can skim the subject.
