## Mobile

My on the go note taking app is obsidian and google keep, my temporary ally is telegram saved message. Let's discuss each on below.

#### Setup 
    
We will use termux application to setup our obsidian + git sync

1. Open termux and do initial setup. 
2. make a directory using termux /sdcard/Obsidian/ and cd into it
3. Clone your second-brain repository. My repo name is Second-Brain-Private.
4. Symlink[^1] /sdcard/Obsidian/Second-Brain-Private/ to ~/Github/Repositories/ in termux, so that we can manage second brain with all github repositories at one place. 
   

[^1]: symlink only works one way because google has restricted android home directory to not have symlinks in their android source.

#### Process

We can use note taking for different sources, each of the source have slightly different processes. Each of which is documented below.
