## Fresh Start

After the recent hard brick, I've managed to restore my device to factory settings. So now writing myself a tutorial of how to root and get to where i was.


## Update

Perform an update from android-11 to [android-13](https://gauss-componentotacostmanua...22/11/18/83d837a54bd647c3902634d271f6cc2d.zip), always remember to do this after msm because it only flashes to your A partition. So an update would flash on both your partitions.

## Preparation

1. Go to settings, enable oem unlock
2. Reboot into fastboot
3. From a terminal type `fastboot oem unlock`
4. You are done
