## Iphone 6s

Yes, i am using iphone 6s in 2023 because both oneplus 8t and iphone were given by relatives after my samsung f62 got stolen. 

## why?

Why do we need to carry 2 separate devices?

1. Iphone is good for payments and other daily activities

2. Android fulfills my curiousity with proper control over my hardware. 

So using both will give me headache to manage but for the price of headaches my curiousity lives and i am good with it. One major headache is 70 percent battery health. Which means 1 hr standby time on full charge and typically 20 to 30 mins max on usage.
