## Installation

I assume that you have a fresh device in your hands.


1. First install OOS 13 with android 13 update 
2. Boot orange fox recovery (boot only, no flashing required)
3. Take a backup of everything, and prepare for MSM (in case you brick your device - dont worry things are good with oneplus 8t) 
4. Flash nameless-aosp android 12.1 from [here.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nameless-aosp/files/kebab/Nameless-AOSP_kebab-12.1-20220823-2345-Official.zip/download)
5. Reboot and your oneplus will not boot twice and that's normal, now it will show partition A has to be formatted, proceed by clicking format.
6. Now you are into nameless aosp, reboot and go to nameless recovery.
7. Click on android sideload and apply update
8. Flash magisk.zip, rename apk to zip
