## Content
PARA method states that every idea, thought or project could be classified into the four categories i.e. Projects, Areas, Resources and Archive.

- **Projects**
	- Short-term goals which are highly actionable and active.
	- Projects are outcomes (goals) which require a dedicated effort (tasks) within a certain timeframe (deadline).
	- Like: Projects, Create YouTube videos, Complete chapter 1 of ....
- **Areas**
	- Long-term goals which are less actionable and usually recurring.
	- Areas are roles or responsibilities which needs ongoing maintenance and do not have specific goal therefore never completed.
	- Recurring tasks comes under this section.
	- Like: health, cooking, cleaning, relations and more.
- **Resources**
	- All the notes, ideas or thoughts that are required to build Projects and Areas.
	- Like: PARA Method, What is Linux.
- **Archive**
	- Anything that is not the part of the above three and are inactive.
	- Like: Abandoned project, Draft notes.

### Projects
There are certain steps for making projects list:
1. Brainstorm your list
	- Write down all the possible projects or things you want to get it done within a timeframe whether it is a big or a small project.
	- Even write the small tasks as they could be part of big projects.
2. Follow the rules
	- Project list should only have at max 10 to 15 items.
	- If more than 15 then move few to future projects.
	- Make significant and visible progress.
	- Never get stuck on a project.
3. Identify false projects
	- Dreams and hobbies are not projects as dreams don't have deadlines and hobbies don't have specific goals.
	- These goes to Areas section.
	- Break down mega projects to smaller sub projects.
