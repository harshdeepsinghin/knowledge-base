# Change required

I was tired of android 12.1 this month so i removed nethunter flashed msn's android 11 and updated to android 13 and rooted that rom. Now I can happily install banking apps which wasn;t working on nh kernel on android 12.


## Changes

We used msn to restore to factory settings and then updated to Android  13.1, which was a horrible experience. Went back to Android 13.


### Hurdles

1. **Fastboot Driver Issue:** Encountering a fastboot driver issue? You can find a helpful guide at [beebom](https://beebom.com/fastboot-not-detecting-device-windows-10).

2. **ADB Device Not Found Error:** If you're getting an "ADB device not found" error, here's how to fix it: First, unlock the device. Then, navigate to the device's settings and enable MTP (Media Transfer Protocol). Ensure that you don't have it set to "charge only." Instead, select the option to "share files." Once this is done, you should be able to use ADB again.

3. **Orangefox and Android 13.1 Compatibility:** The Android 13 build of Orangefox may not work well with Orange Fox. I faced issues flashing recovery because the recovery partition doesn't exist. Additionally, when I boot into Orangefox, I can't find my storage and am unable to mount it. To resolve these problems, I decided to revert back to Android 13 via the MSM route.

### Steps

Here are the steps I took:

- I rooted my device using Magisk.
- After rooting, I added my Google account and performed a basic device backup for contacts.
