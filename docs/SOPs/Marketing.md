## Hubspot

I use this tool for my personal brand [rohanbatrain](), here's a log of what i did so far.

### Log

1. Sign up using an email
2. Head over to Conversations/Inbox/Inbox-Settings
3. Sign in using a gmail account, now remove the gmail account
4. You would see a fallback email, use that email to setup first.
5. when you get a hubspot email, customize it according to your brand.
6. Use email forwarding option and then go to your email client or use dns based mail forwarding. I am using Cloudflare.
